# Description and details

## Answer to Q1:
You did not mention the placeholder text in the input text and password in the design considerations.

## Answer to Q2:
I implemented the placeholder text.

## Concerns and other considerations:

I compiled and executed Cobalt on a virtual machine with Ubuntu 20.04, which gave me a firsthand understanding of its limitations.

I believe that instead of adding functionalities, a more effective approach could be to remove some elements, similar to what YouTube or Google do in their forms.

They don’t use a cursor/caret and don’t use placeholder text. These functionalities were designed for mouse and keyboard usage, not for a user experience with a remote controller.
